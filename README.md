### Scraping 10-K filings from SEC Edgar

**Background**:  US Security and Exchange (SEC) filings are a reliable, standardized source of information regarding public corporations in the US.  In 2002 the SEC mandated that forms be filed online using the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system (previously it was voluntary), thus creating a trove of historical data.  To study corporate governance trends over time, the data within these filings needed to be collected from the filings on the EDGAR server.

The notebook and R scripts in this repository demonstrates how to access raw 10-K filings on the SEC EDGAR website [SEC Edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) and how to wrangle/format the resulting data.  The resulting dataset of US Corporation States from 1994-2019 and the code utilized for this project was published to Harvard's Dataverse Repository for other researchers to utlize for their own research.
